As Eric said many times, we were tasked with making a simplified version of UNO. Now, to which I gladly responded with "Respectfully, no." so I made a full-fledged version of UNO instead! (I have not slept in 3 days üëç)
This version works in a very similar fashion to the normal UNO game we all love (until someone starts with 4 wild cards and we all want to do is scare them while they are drinking a glass of juice so it splashes all over
their clothes... Yeah, I see you Antonin!!). This version only DOESN'T include the following features that UNO players sometimes implement, mainly: NO Stacking +2s and +4s, NO Reversing a +2 or +4 (otherwise known as the 
ULTIMATE UNO REVERSE!!!), and finally +2s and +4s do NOT skip turns in this version. I don't know why that's even a considered rule to begin with! Anyways, have fun! Max playercount of *15* btw, otherwise things break :/
