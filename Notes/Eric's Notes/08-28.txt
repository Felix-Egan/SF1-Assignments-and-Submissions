Review: python as a calculator with memory
==========================================

>>> 3 + 3
> 6

OOO (Order of operations when evaluating)

1. Substitution
2. PEDMAS
3. variable assignment
					     var    value
x = 4						x   4
y = x + x => (4) + (4) => y = 8			y   8  	


New types: floats and strings
=============================

# Consider: calculators have decimal numbers
# So does python

>>> 4.0 + 4.0
> 8.0

Float is a `type`. All data in a computer has two elements: the type and the value

Ex. value: 8, 8.0, 0, -1000, -1.111111, infinite possibilities!
Ex. Type: float, int, finite possibilities!

To see the VALUE of a piece of data in a program, we use the `print` function
To see the TYPE of a piece of data, we use the `type` function

We can change a piece of data from one TYPE to another TYPE, usually. This is called CASTING

int -> float  ex. 8 -> 8.0
float -> int  ex. 8.0 -> 8. 
	BE CAREFUL: we can lose data here!
	CONSIDER: pi (float) to an int. Ex. 3.14159.... -> 3

HOW to convert types
--------------------

Wanna do:    	| function
int -> float 	| float(<your int goes here!>)    ex. float(3)
float -> int    | int( <your float here> )        ex. int(3.0)

New challenger: STRINGS
=======================

Obviously, python can do more than numbers. it can compute on TEXT

STRING is the type of data that is text. String "string" together characters

>>> x = "hello"
>>> type(x)
> string

Type conversion:
----------------

int -> float
float -> int
int -> string??? how do you turn a number into text?
string -> int??? how do you turn text into a number? what is the number for "a"?
float -> string??
string -> float??
