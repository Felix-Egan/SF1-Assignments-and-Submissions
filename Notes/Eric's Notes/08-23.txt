- What is PL?
	- computer speak
	- the opposite of a "natural" lang, or "human" lang
	- same: syntax and grammar
	- PL is very rigid. One wrong move, and its all over -> bugs and errors
	- EVERY software is made via a PL
	- there are TONS of PL
		- Java, JavaScript, Lua, C++, C#, C, Assembly/Machine Language (binary)
	- 2 kinds of PLs:
		We must turn ANY PL into binary. How?
		1. Compiled
			Uses a COMPILER to output a new program in binary
			INPUT: a program in the given PL (a file, "myprogram.java")
			OUTPUT: executable, a new program that is in binary	
			PLs that use compilers: Java, C, C++, C#, 
		2. Interpreted  
			Reads each line of the program one at a time
			And turns each line, one at a time, into binary
			PLs that are interpreted: Python, JS, Java
		Questions:
			How are compiled and interpreted processes different?
			Will compiling run a program? Will interpeting run a program?
			Why would you use one over the other? What are the advantages of either?

What is Python

- Free and Open Source Software (FOSS, FLOSS)
	- Its always going to be free
	- ANYONE can look at the source code, ANYONE can contribute :) 
	- Constrast with: closed source, proprietary software, like MS, 
	- Python FOSS but its also a company

- Python has versions!!
	- updated over the years
	- started with python v1, v2 2000s, v3 today. Difference is HUGE. Be careful

- Python has a TON of applications!
	- Science, data science, in industry, AI, health studies
	- Big pros: easier, syntax isn't so bad.
